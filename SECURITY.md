## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### Where to report

- **Alternative:** Email the maintainer at **mondalsaptarshi7@gmail.com** with a clear subject line (e.g. `[Security] Brief description`). Do not open a public issue for unfixed vulnerabilities.

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability and how it can be reproduced.
- Steps or proof-of-concept if possible.
- Impact (e.g. data exposure, privilege escalation).
- Your environment (browser, extension version) if relevant.

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgment:** We aim to confirm receipt within 5 business days.
- **Updates:** We will keep you informed of progress and any decisions (e.g. accepted, declined, duplicate).
- **If accepted:** We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure. Please do not make the issue public until we have released a fix or agreed on a disclosure date.
- **If declined:** We will explain why. You may still publish your findings after we respond, following responsible disclosure practices.

We appreciate the effort of security researchers and will credit you in advisories or release notes if you wish (unless you prefer to stay anonymous).
